        Advantages of SUNSUL Technology.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Sulphur Cools down very slow the system can produce power after the
            sunset, even in complete darkness for 4-7 hours. Using other
            technology development such as additional internal hydrogen
            generator the system can achieve 24 hour operation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sulphur can reach high temperature because of chemical reaction
            resulting in more efficiency & capacity factor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Filling process is a one step as at the end of the cycle, S2 becomes
            S8 again, restarting the action all over again.
          </li>
          <li>
            Compared to traditional Thermo Solar, Sulphur is environmentally
            friendly and does not damage system parts whereas both salted water
            & oil are not harmful to the environment but the system as well as
            it results in corrosion, deposition etc.
          </li>
          <li>Requires lesser footprint then PV & Thermo System.</li>
          <li>
            It can operate as an open system where S2 can be taken out and sold
            to rubber industry at a good price, in which case S8 will need to be
            refilled, which is an industrial waste material.
