        A breakthrough in renewable and eco-friendly source of energy
        generation, SUNSUL Technology consists of a Tower, a Dish, Dish focus
        actuator, solar heat collector, High temperature Piping, Heat exchanger,
        Heat exchanger coils, Steam Piping, Steam Turbine, Generator, Steam
        Condensing Tank, Sulphur Condensing Tank, S8 Expansion Tank, Pump with
        check Valves and Solar Dish Mirror.{" "}

        The System operates using S8, which is an industrial waste material.
        Heat, generated form Solar Heat Collector converts this S8 into S2 which
        in turn releases immense amount of energy. This energy creates extreme
        high heat of approx. 900 degree Celsius. High temperature piping
        transfers this massive heat to water and the steam thus produced runs
        the turbines and the generator. The Sulphur used in SUNSUL System
        Prototype cools down very slowly and the system can thus produce power
        even after the sunset. Using other technological development such as
        additional internal hydrogen generator, the SUNSUL system can achieve 24
        hour operation.{" "}

        SUNSUL Technology offers some great advantages over the conventional
        Solar PV energy generation. It produces a higher efficient, that is, 60%
        as compared to 18% efficiency of Solar PV, thus resulting in cost
        effectiveness.{" "}
