        An Innovation in the renewable energy sector, Sewage Sludge Incineration
        is a technology that uses high moisture content sludge to burn it at
        source by employing the latest technology equipment for incinerating the
        sewage sludge mixed with RDF Granules, and biogas residue. The
        incinerator is a novel technology with the possibility of harnessing the
        generated heat and energy and using it for electricity generation.
      </p>
      <p className="description_p_tag">
        During the incineration process, combustible material is oxidized and
        energy is released. Only a small amount of energy is lost by radiation
        over the surface of incinerator and the boiler as well as heat in the
        filtered ashes. In our sludge incinerator, 80% of the energy is
        recovered by a boiler, and the generated steam is used to produce
        electricity and heat for the drying of the sewage sludge.

      <p className="description_p_tag">
        During the combustion process, organic pollutants, endocrine disruptors
        and pathogens contained in sewage sludge are destroyed, and volatile
        heavy metals such as quicksilver are transferred to the flue gas. The
        nutrients, especially phosphorus, are not transferred in the form of
        gaseous compounds to the flue gas and are kept in the incinerator ash.
        In fluidized bed incinerators, most of the generated ashes have a very
        small particle size and are transported with the flue gas flow.

      <p className="description_p_tag">
        During the incineration process, sewage sludge is combusted and the
        energy is recovered as heat and electricity. These “products” are first
        of all used to cover the incineration plant’s own consumption; the
        residuary amounts of energy can be sold. The fluidized bed material
        containing some small amount of ash has no market value but can be used
        in road construction for example, or to produce other construction
        materials. The residues from the flue gas cleaning can be
        cost-intensively disposed of or can also be cost-intensively stabilized
        and further used in the construction industry, e.g. for cement
        production, in the manufacture of building ceramics, or as a substitute
        for sand or cement in road construction.
