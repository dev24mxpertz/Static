        The Navrattan Crete has a wide range of Structural Qualities as compared
        to Ordinary Portland Cement. Few of the vital differences are listed
        below
        <ul>
          <li>
            Navrattan Crete has a strengths that can be adjusted to compression
            requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navrattan Crete(NC) has higher Tensile strength than Portland Cement
            (OPC) due to its intrinsic covalent bonding nature.
          </li>
          <li>
            NC meets as well exceeds all the same tensing standards as OPC and
            excels in every category
          </li>
          <li>
            Navrattan Crete has a low coefficient of expansion which facilitates
            it to work in freezing or tropical regions of the world.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navrattan Crete is hydrophobic and therefore highly resistant or
            impervious to water, acids, corrosion, sulfates or more which makes
            it perfect to use for waterproof basements, pipe coatings,
            countertops, waste water tanks, fish farms, docks etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            NC absolutely stops oxidation ensuring no more rusty bars in your
            structure as compared to that of OPC making your structures more
            sustainable and longer lasting.
          </li>
          <li>
            NC binder gives the cement super insulating abilities that results
            in almost no heat transfer no matter what aggregate is used â€“
            including cellulose or rock. Portland blocks would probably explode
            with that much heat
          </li>
          <li>
            Navrattan Crete will not dry or crack skin as lime based OPC does.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navrattan Cement is less expensive to produce than Portland Cement
            and no fossil fuels or heating of materials are needed.
          </li>
        </ul>
