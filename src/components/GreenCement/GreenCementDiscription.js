      The Navrattan Crete is stronger that a conventional cement and has three
      times the compressive and tensile strength of Portland cement and requires
      significantly less energy to produce, thus leaving a substantially smaller
      carbon footprint.High performance green buildings built with green
      materials like Navrattan Crete use less, waste less and produce less green
      house gas emissions than conventional buildings. The Navrattan Crete is
      environment friendly, sustainable, reliable, durable and affordable.

      Buildings are one of the heaviest consumers of natural resources and
      account for a significant portion of the greenhouse gas emissions that
      affect climate change and is definitely not sustainable. Portland cement
      is the most common type of cement used worldwide and is the biggest target
      for reducing the CO2 footprint of building materials.

      Navrattan Crete uses many of the same materials used in blends with
      traditional Portland cement. However, the major difference comes from the
      fact that Navrattan Crete isnâ€™t produced with quarried limestone product.
      Limestone creates an excessive amount of CO2 by virtue of the fact that
      extreme heat is used to create the cement. Navrattan Crete uses a
      proprietary catalyst/binding agent that is combined with materials
      containing alumina silicate that can allow the cement to be produced at
      ambient temperatures, from sub-tropical to below freezing, meaning that it
      takes 80 to 90% less energy to produce and dramatically lowers the CO2
      released into the atmosphere.
