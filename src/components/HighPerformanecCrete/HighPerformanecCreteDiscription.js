        High-Performance Crete that provides either substantially improved
        resistance to environmental influences (durability in service) or
        substantially increased structural capacity while maintaining adequate
        durability. It may also include cement, which significantly reduces
        construction time without compromising long-term serviceability. While
        high strength cement, aims at enhancing strength and consequent
        advantages owing to improved strength, the term high-performance crete
        is used to refer to the concrete of required performance for the
        majority of construction applications.{" "}

        In general, a High-performance Concrete can be defined as that concrete
        which the highest durability for any has given strength class and
        comparison between the concretes of different strength classes is not
        appropriate. This means that, with the available knowledge, one can
        always strive to achieve a better (most durable) concrete required for a
