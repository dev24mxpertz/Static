        Currently, there are around 1.6 million registered buses in India, out
        of which only 170,000 are operated by public bus operators. Only 5,000
        buses are operated under a PPP model for city bus operation. There is a
        need to increase the supply of buses in Indian cities to develop
        sustainable public transport. However, the cities should have a larger
        vision to curb dependence on fossil fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. It is
        right time that public transport vehicles shift their source of power
        from diesel to electric.
