        Advantages of Cholesterol Immunization are:

          <li>It cures atherosclerosis and protects from its reappearance.</li>
          <li>
            It normalizes the cholesterol metabolism makes the deposited
            cholesterol usable, stops the exaggerated production of LDLs and
            ends the cells’ starvation for cholesterol.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regulates the production of essential materials made by cholesterol
            (bail acid, hormones, cell membrane, receptor stabilizing etc.)
          </li>
          <li>Protects against contagions. </li>
          <li>
            Increases the chance of fertilization increases sexual activity and

          <li>
            Ends the absence of insulin if caused by atherosclerosis (the
            pancreas’ artery may be blocked as well, limiting insulin
            production.)
