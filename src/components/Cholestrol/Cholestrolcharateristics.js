        The cholesterol antigen’s ingredient is a highly purified and
        substituted cholesterol base “artificial bacteria”. The structure of the

        After 4 years of storage in the refrigerator (+5 °C) the physical
        behavior of the antigen did not change. The particles were not
        agglutinated; their suspending and microscopic morphology was not
        changed. The grape-form agglutination was preventable by physiological
        intermixture.
