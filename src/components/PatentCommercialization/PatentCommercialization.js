            We have worked with many research and development-oriented clients
            since the inception of their successful technology transfer and
            licensing programs. We have also worked to develop IP strategies for
            the participation in standards organizations and patent pools.
            Although these strategies can present significant business
            opportunities and reduced legal exposure, recent litigation
            histories show that a failure to steer clear of the numerous
            antitrust and related issues can have devastating consequences. Our
            expertise includes working with corporate clients to gain the
            business advantages of IP cooperation while avoiding potential legal
            pitfalls.

            Regardless of the size of an entity's patent portfolio or individual
            licensing opportunities, our expertise allows us to provide advice
            at critical stages to grow and attain a highly-profitable patent
            licensing program. Once a licensing program is established, we work

            effectively. We are the sounding board that provides fresh
            perspectives, giving advice and guidance to research-and-development
            staff in the development of licensable technologies.
